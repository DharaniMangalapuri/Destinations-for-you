The primary objective of the "Destinations for You" project is to create a personalized travel recommendation platform that leverages user preferences, historical travel data, and real-time information to suggest tailored destinations. The project aims to enhance the travel planning experience for users by providing them with curated suggestions aligned with their interests, preferences, and travel history.
